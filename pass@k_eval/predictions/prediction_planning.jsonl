{"task_id": "HumanEval/155", "completion": "1. Start by defining the function and its parameters. In this case, the function is called `even_odd_count` and it takes one parameter called `num`.\n2. Initialize two variables, `even_count` and `odd_count`, to 0. These variables will be used to keep track of the number of even and odd digits in the input number.\n3. Use a loop to iterate through each digit in the input number. For example, if the input number is 12345, the loop would iterate through the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n4. Inside the loop, use an if-statement to check whether the current digit is even or odd. If it's even, increment `even_count` by 1. If it's odd, increment `odd_count` by 1.\n5. After the loop finishes, return a tuple that contains the values of `even_count` and `odd_count`. In Python, you can create a tuple by using parentheses and separating the values with commas. For example: `(even_count, odd_count)`.\n6. Test the function with some sample inputs to make sure it's working correctly. For example, you could call the function"}

Iterate over each character in the string representation of the input number, and for each character, use the dictionary created in step 1 to obtain its corresponding Roman numeral symbol.\n4.

Loop through each word in the input list using a for loop.\n3. For each word, find the number of unique characters it contains by converting the word into a set (which removes duplicates) and then finding the length of the set.\n4. Compare the number of unique characters in the current word with the maximum number of unique characters found so far (stored in `max_word`). If the current word has more unique characters, update `max_word` to be the current word.\n5.

If not, return an array with the total number of eaten carrots and 0 as the second element.\n4.

{"task_id": "HumanEval/160", "completion": "1. First, we need to check if the length of the operator list is equal to the length of the operand list minus one. If it's not, then we need to raise an error.\n2. Next, we need to iterate through the operator list and perform the corresponding operation on the operands. For example, if the current operator is '+', we add the current operand to the result. If the current operator is '-', we subtract the current operand from the result.\n3. We continue this process until we have iterated through all the operators in the list. The final result will be the evaluation of the algebraic expression.\n4. To handle negative numbers, we can use the built-in Python function `abs()` to get the absolute value of each operand before performing any operations. This ensures that the result is always positive, even if one or more of the operands are negative.\n5. Finally, we return the final result as a string, so that it can be easily printed or used in other parts of the program."}
