4. Return the results list.

--------------------------------------------------
HumanEval/153

1. Define a variable `strongest_extension` and set it to an empty string.
2. Loop through each extension in the list of extensions.
3. For each extension, calculate its strength by subtracting the number of lowercase letters from the number of uppercase letters.
4. If the current extension's strength is greater than the `strongest_extension`'s strength, set `strongest_extension` to the current extension.
5. Return a string in the format "ClassName.StrongestExtensionName" using the class name and the strongest extension found.
6. If there are no extensions in the list, return an empty string.

--------------------------------------------------
HumanEval/154

1. Define two variables, `word1` and `word2`, to store the input words.
2. Check if `word2` is a substring of `word1`. If it is, return `True`.
3. If `word2` is not a substring of `word1`, rotate `word2` by one character and check if the rotated string is a substring of `word1`. Repeat this process until all possible rotations have been checked.
4. If any rotation of `word2` is a substring of `word1`, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

--------------------------------------------------
HumanEval/155

1. Start by defining the function and its parameters. In this case, the function is called `even_odd_count` and it takes one parameter called `num`.
2. Initialize two variables, `even_count` and `odd_count`, to 0. These variables will be used to keep track of the number of even and odd digits in the input number.
3. Use a loop to iterate through each digit in the input number. For example, if the input number is 12345, the loop would iterate through the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
4. Inside the loop, use an if-statement to check whether the current digit is even or odd. If it's even, increment `even_count` by 1. If it's odd, increment `odd_count` by 1.
5. After the loop finishes, return a tuple that contains the values of `even_count` and `odd_count`. In Python, you can create a tuple by using parentheses and separating the values with commas. For example: `(even_count, odd_count)`.
6. Test the function with some sample inputs to make sure it's working correctly. For example, you could call the function

--------------------------------------------------
HumanEval/156

1. Define a dictionary to map each digit of the input number to its corresponding Roman numeral symbol. For example, '1' should be mapped to 'I', '2' should be mapped to 'II', and so on.
2. Convert the input number to a string using the `str()` function.
3. Iterate over each character in the string representation of the input number, and for each character, use the dictionary created in step 1 to obtain its corresponding Roman numeral symbol.
4. Concatenate all the Roman numeral symbols obtained in step 3 to form the final Roman numeral equivalent of the input number.
5. Return the final Roman numeral equivalent as a string.
6. Test the function with various inputs to ensure it is working correctly.

--------------------------------------------------
HumanEval/157

1. Start by defining the function and its parameters, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. Calculate the lengths of the sides using the Pythagorean theorem: `c**2 = a**2 + b**2`.
3. Check if the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. If it is, return `True`, otherwise return `False`.
4. Test the function with different input values to ensure it works correctly.

--------------------------------------------------
HumanEval/158

1. Define a variable `max_word` and initialize it to an empty string. This will be used to store the word with the maximum number of unique characters.
2. Loop through each word in the input list using a for loop.
3. For each word, find the number of unique characters it contains by converting the word into a set (which removes duplicates) and then finding the length of the set.
4. Compare the number of unique characters in the current word with the maximum number of unique characters found so far (stored in `max_word`). If the current word has more unique characters, update `max_word` to be the current word.
5. If multiple words have the same maximum number of unique characters, compare them using lexicographical order and return the one that comes first.
6. Return the final value of `max_word`.

--------------------------------------------------
HumanEval/159

1. Check if there are enough carrots to meet the need. If not, return an array with the total number of eaten carrots and 0 as the second element.
2. Calculate the total number of eaten carrots by adding the number of carrots already eaten and the number of carrots needed.
3. Check if there are any remaining carrots after eating. If not, return an array with the total number of eaten carrots and 0 as the second element.
4. Calculate the number of remaining carrots by subtracting the total number of eaten carrots from the number of remaining carrots.
5. Return an array with the total number of eaten carrots and the number of remaining carrots.

--------------------------------------------------
HumanEval/160

1. First, we need to check if the length of the operator list is equal to the length of the operand list minus one. If it's not, then we need to raise an error.
2. Next, we need to iterate through the operator list and perform the corresponding operation on the operands. For example, if the current operator is '+', we add the current operand to the result. If the current operator is '-', we subtract the current operand from the result.
3. We continue this process until we have iterated through all the operators in the list. The final result will be the evaluation of the algebraic expression.
4. To handle negative numbers, we can use the built-in Python function `abs()` to get the absolute value of each operand before performing any operations. This ensures that the result is always positive, even if one or more of the operands are negative.
5. Finally, we return the final result as a string, so that it can be easily printed or used in other parts of the program.

--------------------------------------------------
HumanEval/161

1. Check if the input string contains any letters. If it does not contain any letters, reverse the string and return it.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string.
3. For each character, check if it is a letter. If it is a letter, reverse its case (i.e., convert lowercase to uppercase or vice versa).
4. If the character is not a letter, keep it as it is.
5. Return the resulted string.

--------------------------------------------------
HumanEval/162

1. Check if the input string 'text' is empty. If it is, return None.
2. Convert the input string to a byte array using the `bytes()` function.
3. Create an MD5 hash object using the `hashlib.md5()` function.
4. Update the hash object with the byte array representation of the input string using the `update()` method.
5. Return the hexadecimal digest of the hash object using the `hexdigest()` method.

--------------------------------------------------
HumanEval/163

1. Define two variables, `a` and `b`, to store the positive integers passed as arguments to the function.
2. Initialize an empty list, `even_digits`, to store the even digits between `a` and `b`.
3. Use a loop to iterate over each digit in the range of `a` to `b`.
4. For each digit, check if it is even by using the modulo operator (`% 2 == 0`). If it is even, add it to the `even_digits` list.
5. After the loop completes, sort the `even_digits` list in ascending order using the built-in `sorted()` function.
6. Return the sorted `even_digits` list as the output of the function.
